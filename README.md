### Prerequisites
```
sklearn
scipy
numpy
matplotlib
```

## Running the tests

To run the test on the given datasets you need to generate data samples from their original datasets.

```
# Step 1. run this code to generate synthetic data for exp 2
python Exp2_Syn_dataGenerator.py

# Step 2. run this code to generate synthetic data for exp 3
python Exp2_Syn_dataGenerator.py
```
Now you should be able to reproduce the experiment by runing located under the main folder.
```
python kMeansChi2_Exp3.py
python kMeansChi2_Exp2.py
python EIkMeans_Exp3.py
python EIkMeans_Exp2.py
```

## Detect Concept Drift
Given data batches ```Batch_train``` and ```Batch_test``` and the desired signficance level ```alpha```
```
import EIkMeans_lib as eikm

num_train = Batch_train.shape[0]
num_test = Batch_test.shape[0]

# According to the constrains of Pearson's Chi-square Test
# It's better to keep no less than 50 samples in each partition
num_partitions = num_train / 50

# Initialize EI-kMeans instances and build the histogram (partitions)
eikm_instance = eikm.EIkMeans(num_partitions)
eikm_instance.build_partition(Batch_train, num_test)

# Performing concept drift detection
eikm_instance.drift_detection(Batch_test, alpha)
```
